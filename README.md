# CRM-Analytics

In this project, a real dataset from FLO, an online shoe retailer, is used to perform customer segmentation and predict customer lifetime value (CLTV). The dataset consists of information derived from the past purchasing behaviors of FLO customers who made their most recent purchases between 2020 and 2021 as OmniChannel shoppers (engaging in both online and offline transactions).
The project is carried out in two main stages. In the first stage, an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was conducted to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and to support targeted marketing strategies. In the second stage, FLO aims to establish a roadmap for its sales and marketing activities by estimating the potential future value that existing customers will generate for the company in the medium to long term. For this purpose, BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models were implemented to calculate CLTV, and customer segments were formed according to their predicted CLTV values.

In the same file, another project based on the Online Retail II dataset was also conducted. This dataset contains online sales transactions of a UK-based retail company between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The companyâ€™s product catalog mainly consists of gift items, and it is known that most of its customers are wholesalers.

The objective of this project is to help the company define a roadmap for its sales and marketing activities by predicting the potential future value that existing customers will generate, enabling medium- to long-term strategic planning. In the first part of the analysis, the BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models were implemented to estimate the 6-month CLTV, including analyses over different time periods. In the second part, RFM metrics were calculated, RFM scores were generated and converted into a single variable, and the RF scores were used to define customer segments.
