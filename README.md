# CRM-Analytics

In this project, a real dataset from FLO, an online shoe retailer, is used to perform customer segmentation and predict customer lifetime value (CLTV). The dataset consists of information derived from the past purchasing behaviors of FLO customers who made their most recent purchases between 2020 and 2021 as OmniChannel shoppers (engaging in both online and offline transactions).
The project is carried out in two main stages. In the first stage, an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was conducted to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and to support targeted marketing strategies. In the second stage, FLO aims to establish a roadmap for its sales and marketing activities by estimating the potential future value that existing customers will generate for the company in the medium to long term. For this purpose, BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models were implemented to calculate CLTV, and customer segments were formed according to their predicted CLTV values.
